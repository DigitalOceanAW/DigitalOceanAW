1. Make sure the old droplet and old images are deleted from the digital ocean
   account for DigitalOceanAW.

2. cd into DigitalOceanAW and run the command
   "$(cat .secrets/BasicAccess_token)" to set environment variables.

3. Enter the command "make"

4. If prompted for input, simply type "yes" and enter - be careful not to
   accidentally enter something else and have to start all over again.

5. If the image is taking extra long to respond, manually demonstrate that
   everything works by typing:

       "curl -i -H POST <<IP>>/api/v1/echo -d 'arbitrary message'"

   The IP is stored in terraform/ip.txt, or cd into terraform and type the
   command "terraform output ip_addr".
